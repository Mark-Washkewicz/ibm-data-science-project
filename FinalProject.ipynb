    "    \n",
    "<p> As my Final Project I have chosen to determine the best location for a Large Coffee Chain to get its introduction into Toronto. In today's Modern age, many large chains like Starbucks are constantly expanding to new markets. Although Toronto already has many Starbucks's coffee shops, many popular coffee chains in the United States, like Peet's Coffee, could have interest in expanding into the Global Market. As Canada is near the U.S. and Toronto is one of the biggest citties in Canada, it would make logical sense for them to analyze the number of coffee shops in a given neighborhood per capita to determine which neighborhoods are lacking Coffee shops and to expand there. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2> Data </h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The data gathered for this project was the different neighborhoods and postcodes in Toronto (Wikipedia), location data on these neighborhoods, <a href=\"https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/hlt-fst/pd-pl/Table.cfm?Lang=Eng&T=1201&SR=1&S=22&O=A&RPP=9999&PR=0\"> census data </a> on the population in these different neighborhoods, and the number of coffee shops in these neighborhoods.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> Once the data was gathered the dataframes had to be cleaned and conglomerated so that the number of coffee shops per capita could be found. This was done by combining the CSV from the Canadian government with Foursquare and Location data. It should be noted that certain neighborhoods were removed due to their low populations that would skew the per capita, and as we only care about other popular coffee shops, we only took the coffee shops that were in the top 500 squarespace venues. Once all of this data is combined, the coffee shops per capita for each neighborhood can be calculated and the lowest coffee shops per capita is where a coffee shop should open.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2> Methodology </h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> The different data was read using different read functions from pandas. The postal codes and neighborhoods were read using the read_html funciton and the csv for neighborhoods was read_csv. By using these two functions, coupled with merge. We are able to combine the data into one new df. Which allows us to see the population for each neighborhood along with the number of popular coffee shops. We then take the per capita number of coffee shops by using the pandas div function. And then finally we sort by the per capita in ascending order to determine which area has the least number of coffee shops per capita </p>\n",

    "<p> As you can see from the above df, the majority of Central Toronto and and Downtown Toronto have the highest coffee shops per capita. From this we can determine that we would not like to introduce a new coffee shop in this area as it is already saturated with coffee shops. The best place to establish a new coffee shop would be  in M1V, in the District of Scarborough. This area has a lot of population but very few popular coffee shops. By introducing it here a new coffee chain would have the highest chance of success. </p>\n",

    "<p> Overall, this project focused on combining data from multiple data sources from across the web and learning how to combine them into one df to determine per capita data. This is a very powerful tool, as it can be used for many applications, like determining the best location to start a new restaurant, business, or clothing store. From this project we were able to determine that M1V postcode needs more coffee! </p> "
